# AI & Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains multiple AI and computer vision projects implemented in Python using Google Colab, focusing on deep learning, CNNs, and NLP. Each notebook is self-contained and demonstrates different AI/ML techniques applied to real-world tasks.

Finding_laneLines.ipynb
Description: Lane detection from road images/videos using computer vision techniques.
Tech Stack: OpenCV, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
Highlights: Demonstrates edge detection, Hough transforms, and lane-line tracking.

ICH_CNN_(2).ipynb
Description: Intracerebral Hemorrhage detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Tech Stack: TensorFlow/Keras, Python, CNNs
Highlights: Binary/multi-class classification with model evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix).

News_Classification.ipynb
Description: Text classification of news articles using NLP techniques.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLP preprocessing
Highlights: Implements tokenization, vectorization, and classification models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).

trafficsign_classification.ipynb
Description: Classification of traffic signs using CNN models.
Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNNs
Highlights: Image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with high accuracy on test dataset.
